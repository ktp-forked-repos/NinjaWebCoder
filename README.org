* NinjaWebCoder v1.2.7
A user script for [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/][GreaseMonkey]]. It's designed for the top tier developers. It helps the keyboard ninja work around those crap enterprise web applications by extracting text content using keyboard ONLY.

The key idea is borrowed from those hardcore Emacs geeks.

Features:
- supports [[https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira][JIRA]]
- supports [[http://stackoverflow.com][stackoverflow]]
- supports [[https://github.com/kpumuk/codecolorer][codecolorer]]
- supports [[http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/][syntaxhighlighter]]
- supports phpBB forum
- supports [[http://github.com][github]]
- supports the code embedded in <pre> tag
- supports one liner embedded in <p> tag

* Why NinjaWebCoder?
** Use case one
The new CTO in your company want to *re-invent the workflow*. You are required to create git feature branch with "meaningful" branch name. Using simple issue number like "DD-106" is forbidden from now on.

So you install the NinjaWebCoder. Press Ctrl-E to copy the issue title from the bug tracker.

Then you run the following command line in terminal to create a new branch name.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout -b `brname`
#+END_SRC

"brname" is a bash function defined in your ~/.bashrc. It should be optional unless the issue title is written by the non-technical business analyst and contains funny characters.

The definition of "brname" in OS X:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
function brname () {
    local str=`getclip | sed -e 's/^ \+//g' -e 's/ \+$//g' -e 's/[" -#\(]\+/_/g' -e "s/'//g" -e 's/\(.*\)/\L\1/'`
    echo $str
}
#+END_SRC

The definition of "brname" in Linux:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
function brname () {
    local str=`xclip -o| sed -e 's/^ \+//g' -e 's/ \+$//g' -e 's/[" -#\(]\+/_/g' -e "s/'//g" -e 's/\(.*\)/\L\1/'`
    echo $str
}
#+END_SRC

So you should be grateful to your CTO. You stand out because he *slows down other developers*.
** Use case two
You are reading some online programming tutorial (For example, [[https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_00][Angular JS]] tutorial).

You need paste lots of sample code from tutorial into your IDE to finish a chapter.

Then NinjaWebCoder could help you.
* Install
It's at [[https://openuserjs.org/scripts/redguardtoo/NinjaWebCoder][openuserjs.org]]. It supports both Google Chrome and Firefox.

* Set up
Nothing to set up

* Usage
Press Ctrl-E.

Then text content embedded in the html page will be highlighted by some visual hint.

Press the keyboard according to the hint. The content is into the clipboard.

* Demo
As you can see, after pressing "Ctrl-E", a yellow background hint with text "a" appears at the left top corner of the code snippet.

I follow the hint and press "a", the snippet is copied into clipboard.

* Credits
Most hint related code is borrowed from [[https://github.com/mooz][Masafumi Oyamada (aka mooz)]]. His project [[https://github.com/mooz/keysnail][keysnail]] (a Emacs simluation in firefox) inspired me.

Victor van den Elzen designed the algorithm to produce the text hints.
